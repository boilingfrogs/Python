# Indexing and Slicing
# Indexing ==> [ ] ==> Square bracket ==> Subscript Operator
# Indexing always starts from 0 (zero) to Length - 1
# Negative Indexing ==> -length to -1
# Slicing ==> To extract a substring out of a string []
# Slicing ==> [start : end] ==> [included : excluded]

# B  O  I  L  I  N  G  F  R  O  G  S
# 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 ==> (+ve indexing)
# 12 11 10 9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  ==> (-ve indexing)

# r ==> RAW String
# Treat the string as it is. Don't escape any characters.
